      <description>Research Interests: I am interested in many things relating to archives and libraries, including: making digital preservation activities accessible and actionable; digital preservation workflows, standards and certification; open government, open data, and citizen engagement; and subjects relating to archival theory and practice more broadly, such as community archives and decolonization.

      <description>Hello. I am an archivist and librarian. I work as the Digital Preservation Librarian for Scholars Portal, the information technology service for the Ontario Council of University Libraries. I am responsible for overseeing the preservation of shared licensed content content, such as journals and books, and developing, maintaining and supporting services to enable our members preserve their own digital assets. My responsibilities include maintaining the Scholars Portal Trustworthy Digital Repository, running the Permafrost digital preservation service, and developing new services and training opportunities to meet member needs.</description>
