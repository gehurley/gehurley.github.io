<p><img src="https://www.granthurley.ca/img/hurley3.jpg" class="me" alt="Grant Hurley" align="right";> Hello! I am an archivist and librarian. My pronouns are he/him. I work as the Canadiana Librarian for the <a href="https://fisher.library.utoronto.ca">Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library</a> at the University of Toronto. I also serve as a sessional instructor for the <a href="https://ischool.utoronto.ca/">Faculty of Information</a> at the University of Toronto for the course <a href="https://ischool.utoronto.ca/course/processing-digital-archives/">INF2229H: Processing Digital Archives</a>.</p>

<p>The work of stewarding library collections, both digitial and physical, is grounded on Indigenous lands. I am grateful to live on the traditional lands of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River.</p>

<p>At the Fisher Library, I serve as the curator of our significant and extensive Canadian collections with a focus on primary sources and rare books documenting Canadian history and the literatures of Canada. My work includes building and maintaining a diverse, dynamic, and responsive suite of Canadian collections through purchase and donation; creating original catalogue records and descriptions for printed books and archival collections, including remediating problematic language and metadata in legacy descriptions; and providing responsive reference, teaching and outreach services to students, faculty, staff at the university and researchers and community members in Toronto and beyond. In all of my work, I aim to bring life to the complex, colourful, and multi-layered stories that come from these lands through the thoughtful activation of our library&rsquo;s remarkable collections.</p>

<p>From 2016-2022 I worked as the Digital Preservation Librarian at <a href="https://scholarsportal.info">Scholars Portal</a>, the information technology service for the Ontario Council of University Libraries, where I led a portfolio of preservation and storage services, including the creation of the <a href="https://permafrost.scholarsportal.info">Permafrost</a> digital preservation service.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always happy to talk about my work with others and you can find my mentorship profile on <a href="http://www.alimb.ca/2018/05/01/grant-hurley/">Alimb</a>!</p>

<p>I started my career as a summer archives assistant at the <a href="http://ccarchives.ca">Charlotte County Archives</a> in my hometown of St. Andrews, New Brunswick on the traditional and unceded territory of the Peskotomuhkati (Passamaquoddy). I was 16 and it was my first real summer job - and it turns out, led to my career! I returned to the Archives for three summers after that, and in that time, fell in love with the exciting and dynamic work that happens in archives on a daily basis. After pursuing a research interest in Canadian literature through a BA and MA, I completed the Dual Master of Archival Studies and Master of Library and Information Studies program at the University of British Columbia in 2015.</p>

<p>Outside of my work, I love to cook up big meals, shake up cocktails, collect Canadian music of the 1960s and 70s, go on hikes, and read thick and thin books. I just finished the WSET Level 3 certification in wine, so hit me with your wine questions in addition to your archival ones.</p>
